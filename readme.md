<h1 align="center" id="title">AES Brute-Force Breaker</h1>

<p id="description">This Python code performs a brute-force attack on AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) encryption. The code attempts to find the encryption key by trying all possible 20-bit keys and verifying them against known plain-text and cipher-text pairs.</p>

<h2>üõ†Ô∏è Installation Steps:</h2>

<p>1. Install the required cryptography library by running:</p>

```
$ pip install cryptography
```

<p>2. Place your plaintexts in a file named aesPlaintexts.txt and ciphertexts in a file named aesCiphertexts.txt and store it in the same directory as the python code.</p>

<p>3. Run the code by running the command</p>

```
$ python3 CS23MTECH11004_PROGHW2A.py
```
